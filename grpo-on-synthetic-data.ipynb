They have a car that gets an average of 30 miles per gallon, and gas costs $2.50 per gallon.

We are given that $P = 100$.\nSince the skateboard is over $100, Leila gets a 15% discount.\nThe discount amount is 15% of $100, which is $0.15 \\times 100 = 15$.\nThe price Leila will pay after the discount is $100 - 15 = 85$.\nTherefore, Leila will pay $85 for her new skateboard.\n<SOLUTION>85

If she adds 2/3 of the shells she found on Tuesday to the shells she already had, how many seashells does Leila have now? \nAnswer:\n2. Since Leila wants to add 2/3 of the shells she found on Tuesday to the shells she already had, first, let's calculate 2/3 of the shells she found on Tuesday. 2/3 of shells found on Tuesday = (2/3) * 8 = 5.33 \nResponse:\n<start_working_out>\nLet $M$ be the number of shells Leila found on Monday, and $T$ be the number of shells Leila found on Tuesday.\nWe are given that Leila found 15 shells on Monday, so $M = 15$.\nShe found 8 more shells on Tuesday, so $T = 8$.\nThe total number of shells Leila found is $M + T = 15 + 8 = 23$.\nLeila adds 2/3 of the shells she found on Tuesday to the shells she already had. So, the number of shells added is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times T = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 8 = \\frac{16}{3}$.\nSince the number of shells must be an integer, we can assume that Leila adds 2/3 of the shells she found on Tuesday to the shells \nExtracted:\nNone\n******************** Question:\nMaya and her family are going on a road trip from their home in New York to visit their friends in Florida.
